                <h2>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport</h2>
                <p>The top spot for the world’s fastest supercar goes to Bugatti. In 2019, pilot Andy Wallace railed a
                    tweaked-version of the 1,600 hp, 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged Chiron Super Sport around the
                    Ehra-Lessien
                    track. The modifications included lengthening the body by 10 inches, lowering it and giving it a new
                    rear aero kit, as well as a new exhaust setup. The real heroes, however, were the Michelin Pilot
                    Sport
                    Cup 2 tires that were x-rayed before fitment to ensure perfect structural integrity.</p>

                <h2>Bugatti Bolide</h2>
                <p>Inspired by the Molsheim manufacturer’s Vision Le Mans concept, Bugatti’s Bolide combines its
                    fantastical
                    X-themed design language with the brand’s unprecedented W-16 power plant to yield an estimated top
                    speed
                    in excess of 311 mph. Bolstered by a lightweight monocoque incorporating titanium and carbon fiber,
                    the
                    Bolide presents a sci-fi aesthetic that complements what are hyped to be otherworldly performance
                    figures. Those specs are promised to include a zero-to-60 mph time of less than 2 seconds.</p>

                <p>Hennessey Performance Engineering’s Venom F5 picks up the baton from its older sibling and rockets
                    away.
                    A 6.6-liter twin-turbo V-8 pumps out 1,817 hp and 1,193 ft lbs of twist, which propels the
                    2,950-pound
                    coupe to 60 mph in under two seconds. And in case you were wondering, its name is an homage to the
                    F5
                    category of tornados, the most intense level possible on the Fujita scale.</p>

                <h2>SSC Tuatara</h2>
                <p>In October of 2020, SSC North America’s founder Jerod Shelby took his latest hypercar to a Nevada
                    desert
                    and hammered out a run that was touted to have averaged 316.11 mph. The internet, however, was
                    skeptical, and shredded that session’s data in short order, negating it. In January of 2021, Shelby
                    decamped to proving grounds at Kennedy Space Center for a redux, bringing ample recording devices
                    and
                    external groups to monitor. That trial resulted in a 279.2 mph speed on a northbound run, followed
                    by
                    the car reaching 286.1 mph on a southbound pass. Those (certified) results average to 282.9 mph,
                    which
                    is more than enough to notch the SSC Tuatara above the Koenigsegg Agera RS on this list.</p>

                <h2>Koenigsegg Jesko</h2>
                <p>Until the promised Jesko Absolut model achieves its projected top speed of more than 310 mph, please
                    draw
                    your attention to the standard-issue Jesko, which is anything but a standard supercar. The Swedish
                    manufacturer’s 5.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine is mated to a novel Light Speed gearbox that can
                    handle
                    its prodigious output, which can reach 1,600 hp when running on E85 biofuel. Even more remarkable
                    about
                    the Jesko are its aerodynamics, which in the (even more) limited production Jesko Attack model
                    produce
                    more than 3,000 pounds of downforce. Although all 125 examples of the Jesko are currently sold out.</p>

                <h2>Koenigsegg Agera RS</h2>
                <p>In November of 2017, a Koenigsegg Agera RS, running E85 fuel (meaning it was getting 1,360 hp), was
                    driven by a factory driver to a two-way average speed of 277.8 mph on an 11-mile strip of closed
                    road in
                    Nevada. The car, owned by a customer who suggested the feat, actually hit 284.5 mph during the
                    record
                    attempt, which is staggering. At the time, it also nabbed the fastest zero-to-250 mph-to-zero metric
                    (33.2 seconds), the highest average speed during the flying kilometer (268 mph) and for the flying
                    mile
                    on a public road (276.3 mph).</p>

                <h2>Hennessey Venom GT</h2>
                <p>John Hennessey’s eponymously named performance group is obsessed with power and speed, evidenced by
                    shoehorning as much oomph as it can into production cars from other manufacturers. Then Hennessey
                    built
                    his own supercar in 2014, powered by a 7.0-liter twin-turbo GM V-8 packing 1,244 hp and 1,287 ft lbs
                    of
                    torque. The Venom reached 270.4 mph at the Kennedy Space Center’s 3.2-mile landing strip, but only
                    in
                    one direction. Since both directions are required for a record-holding run, in addition to a
                    production.</p>

                <h2>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport</h2>
                <p>Here’s yet another Bugatti, this one built back in 2010 for the sole purpose of securing the accolade
                    of
                    fastest production car ever built. And the Veyron Super Sport achieved it, per Guinness. From the
                    same
                    W-16 power plant, engineers managed to eke out an additional 180 hp, bringing the grand total to
                    1,184
                    hp. To unlock the potential for max speed, you’ll need a second key that’ll give unfettered access
                    to
                    the engine.</p>

                <h2>Bugatti Mistral</h2>
                <p>Just about any Bugatti will make the cut among the world’s fastest production cars, if simply because
                    the
                    quad-turbo W-16 engine, first pioneered by the Veyron, established an entirely new era of
                    four-figure
                    horsepower output back in 2005. The Veyron managed a 253 mph top speed then and Bugatti consistently
                    upped that number through 2019, when the Chiron Super Sport 300+ managed a 304.7 mph
                    single-direction
                    run. But the Veyron, Chiron, Bolide and others were all coupes—now Bugatti plans to take a new world
                    record home to Molsheim with the Mistral roadster, which features a final application of the
                    quad-turbo.

                <p>With twice the power of a Formula 1 car, the ability to hit 60 mph in under two seconds and a $2.4
                    million sticker price, the new Rimac Nevera should intimidate even an experienced hypercar owner.
                    Yet
                    the automaker’s 33-year-old founder, Mate Rimac, intended his masterpiece to be a highly usable,
                    no-fuss
                    grand tourer. So which is it—Hyde or Jekyll? The answer from behind the wheel, amazingly, is both.
